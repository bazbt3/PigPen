# Using PigPen.py

## At this stage in lieu of explanation here's a simple (large) dump from the running app:

```
PigPen menu:

 r reply        g get post
 rp repost      gt get thread
 f follow
 b bookmark     h hashtag
 msg message    gm get msgs
 s subscribed   gc get channel
menu show menu ------- Exit quit

@bazbt3 huh. May need to run it through 2to3. Been a while since I looked at it, though.

@bazbt3  @33MHz You create a post with the reply_to parameter referencing the post you are replying to.

@33MHz Or use six to target both. I think there are still distros shipping 2.x as standard. @bazbt3

@bazbt3 Oh nice! I'm currently trying to document PNUTpy whenever I find the time for it. This [files.pnut.io] is how far I've come. (Spoiler: not very far)

2017-10-29 11:46:43+00:00
@bazbt3 I'm also a Python noob, so I'll need some time. Yes, I have! My plan was to create a fork when the first section is complete, and submit PRs. Thinking about it, I could do that now, as the 'files' part is mostly done!

@bazbt3 RSS posting like this makes me wonder if people wouldn't be better served posting these to channels in some cases. Channels being nice for purpose-driven posting.

@schmidt_fu:  p:214999 t:214632
2017-10-31 12:01:23+00:00
@33MHz @bazbt3 Posting to channels would be a nice addition to #rtpaasfp anyway. Apart from that, the current posting rate doesn't seem alarming to me, <30 posts/hour on the most days, even with the last 100 users added.

@blumenkraft:  p:215000 t:214632

@schmidt_fu posing to channels for RtPaaS (fP) is already on the issues list. :) @33MHz @bazbt3

@bazbt3 Suggest you check out:

KeepAChangeLog.com to polish your changelog format.

Multiline strings with ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù delimiters to simplify some of your text displays.

f-strings to simplify interpolation.

2017-11-02 12:40:10+00:00
@bazbt3 Mostly that grouping by Added, Removed, Changed, Fixed, etc sections makes it a lot easier to get the gist of a version‚Äôs changes.

I tend to second the #BooksMonday, since any kind of literacy and education seem to be utterly missing from politics in many countries currently.

It's nearly Sunday and we currently have a tie!!
We don't have many votes yet because I was late posting, after an *Uncertain* week, no time. ;)

Our theme for tomorrow is
#BookMonday!
I closed the poll, here:

A shame I didn't prepare early, again. Next month I'd appreciate being kicked around a bit to remind me, early.
