I intended to use the `docs` folder to host a GitHub Pages site for the PigPen documentation, *specifically* to create an RSS feed for the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and only incidentally feed changes of the remainder of the documentation.

I wanted it to be easy, all the heavy lifting managed by the Jekyll & GitHub infrastructure.

Naah, I can't figure it out, at least not how to get the feed to work with **pages**.  I find this somewhat ironic.
