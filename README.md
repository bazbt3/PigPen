# What is 'PigPen'?
A Python 2 application to interact with the [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) social network.  My work here covers the absolute basics.

This document covers v0.01.21 onwards.

## A recent screenshot

```
PigPen menu:
 p post         m mentions(user)

 rp repost      gt get thread
 f follow
 b bookmark     h hashtag
 msg message    gm get msgs

@bazbt3 huh. May need to run it through 2to3. Been a while since I looked at it, though.

## What I needed to make this work
* A [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) account; no [developer account](https://pnut.io/dev) is required for single-user apps,
* Python 2, via the iOS [Pythonista app](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/)
* [`StaSh`](https://gist.github.com/CodyKochmann/4d6b40e77ba862e634185a038d2c3f13), a bash-like shell for Pythonista, to give `pip`, which allows installation ofâ€¦ 
* @thrrgilag's [`PNUTpy` library](https://github.com/pnut-api/PNUTpy),
* Access to the good people of pnut.io, for when comprehension failed,
* Half a brain.

### Repo structure:
If you want to know more, the most important things to look at here are:

* The **[Documentation.](/docs/00-index.md)**  A work in progress,
* The [CHANGELOG,](CHANGELOG.md)
* The **PigPen.py** app, obviously.  The code comments will likely always be more useful than the documentation,
* This README file.

## Why did I do this?
Good question.
