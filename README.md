# What is 'PigPen'?
A Python application to allow interactions with the [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) social network.  My work here covers the absolute basics.

This document covers v0.3.0 onwards.

## A recent 'screenshot':

As you can see, there are layout bugs aplenty. And ordinary bugs too.

## What I needed to make this work
* A [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) account; no [developer account](https://pnut.io/dev) is required for single-user apps,
* Python, via the iOS [Pythonista app](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/). Note: I'm converting the application from Python 2.7 to 3.5 (see the documentation.)
* [`StaSh`](https://gist.github.com/CodyKochmann/4d6b40e77ba862e634185a038d2c3f13), a bash-like shell for Pythonista, to give `pip`, which allows installation of‚Ä¶ 
* @33MHz & @thrrgilag's [`PNUTpy`](https://github.com/pnut-api/PNUTpy) library,
* Access to the good people of pnut.io, for when comprehension failed,
* Half a brain.

### Repo structure:
If you want to know more, the most important things to look at here are:

* The **[Documentation.](/docs/00-index.md)**
* The [CHANGELOG.](CHANGELOG.md)
* The **PigPen.py** app, obviously.  The code comments will likely always be more useful than the documentation,
* This README file.

## Why did I do this?
Good question.

## Why 'PigPen'?
App names are chosen throughout the pnut.io developer community to reflect the pnut (peanut) name. After a *lot* of thought I decided to choose PigPen from the Peanuts show character Pig-Pen; he's a scruffy boy without a name.

Incidentally, it took longer choosing the app name than it did to get to the first release to GitHub!
