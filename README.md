# What is 'PigPen'?
A Python 2 application to interact with the [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) social network.  My work here covers the absolute basics.

## What I needed to make this work?
* A [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) account; no developer account requirement for single-user apps,
* Python 2, via the iOS Pythonista app,
* `StaSh`, a bash-like shell for Pythonista, to give `pip`, which allows installation ofâ€¦ 
* @thrrgilag's `PNUTpy` library,
* Access to the good people of pnut.io, for when comprehension failed,
* Half a brain.

### Repo structure:
If you want to know more, the most important things to look at here are:

* The **[Documentation.](/docs/00-index.md)**  A work in progress,
* The [CHANGELOG,](CHANGELOG.md)
* The **PigPen.py** app, obviously.  The code comments will likely always be more useful than the documentation,
* This README file.

## Why did I do this?
Good question.
